* My Emacs Configuration

This is my emacs configuration repository. My Emacs version is 28 with native compilation. So If your Emacs version is lower, you'll not use my configuration successfully.

** Dependences
   - cmake
   - git
   - The dependences in [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework][Emacs Application Framework]].(To use EAF)

** Installation
   To use my configuration, you should run ~make install~ to download the EAF.And then you can open emacs.
   Now I'm using [[https://github.com/SpringHan/sniem][Sniem]] as my edition method and I'm a Colemak user. So if you don't want to use it, you can add ~~:disable~~ into the sniem package manager code of config in the [[https://github.com/SpringHan/.emacs.d/master/blob/etc/settings/init-sniem.el][init-sniem.el]].

** Functions
   My package manager is ~gpack~ (A package manager written by me).
   [[https://github.com/SpringHan/gpack][Click Here]] to know about it.

** Transparent Background
   The transparent background is opened by default.You can use ~C-q C-a~ to change it.Or if you don't want to open it by default, you can use ~C-q n~ to disable it.

** Last
   I'm new in emacs, I'll continue to update my configuration everyday.
